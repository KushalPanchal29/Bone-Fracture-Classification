This repository contains the code and data for the research paper "Leveraging Transfer Learning in Computer Vision for AI-Powered Orthopedic Assistance: A Sustainable Approach for Healthcare 4.0".

The paper presents a deep learning system for classifying bone fractures from X-ray images. The system utilizes the VGG16 convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture and transfer learning to achieve high accuracy.

Key Features:

* VGG16 CNN: Employs the pre-trained VGG16 model as a feature extractor.
* Transfer Learning: Leverages the knowledge learned by VGG16 on a large dataset (ImageNet) to improve performance on the bone fracture classification task.
* High Accuracy: Achieves a 99.57% accuracy in classifying fractured and non-fractured bones.

Data:

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of X-ray images of fractured and non-fractured bones.

Code:

The code is implemented in Python using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries. It includes modules for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Results:

The system achieves state-of-the-art results on the bone fracture classification task, demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning in this domain.

Applications:

This research has potential applications in:

* AI-powered orthopedic assistance
* Automated bone fracture detection
* Healthcare 4.0

This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of the proposed system, allowing researchers and developers to reproduce the results and explore further applications of transfer learning in computer vision for healthcare.
